//! Cursor writer — HIGH confidence (MCP).
//!
//! Config-schema landmines: MCP key `mcpServers` in `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
//! (global) / `.cursor/mcp.json` (project). URL transport uses `url`. Cursor has
//! no native Skills concept (it uses Rules `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`), so a skill
//! install surfaces a copy-paste fallback — but a skill is never offered for
//! Cursor anyway (backend agent_compat: skill → claude-code + openclaw only).
//! Source: cursor.com/docs/mcp + /rules (2026-06-04).
